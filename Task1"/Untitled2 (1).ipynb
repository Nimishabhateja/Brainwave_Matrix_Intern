After all, anyone with any sense whatsoever will stay far, far away from working for this Administration at all, because of Trump s penchant for ruining the lives and careers of everyone around him via public humiliation. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that an  email prankster  from the United Kingdom managed to trick several White House officials into believing he was Jared Kushner.According to CNN, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert feel for the hoax. The email read: Tom, we are arranging a bit of a soir e towards the end of August. It would be great if you could make it, I promise food of at least comparible (sic) quality to that which we ate in Iraq. Should be a great evening. Bossert returned the email to the Kushner imposter, and even gave the person his own email address: Thanks, Jared. With a promise like that, I can t refuse. Also, if you ever need it, my personal email is  (redacted).Here is an image of the exchange, via CNN:Now, this guy is in charge of advising the loons in the White House on how to keep us safe. Yet, he was too dumb to realize that this was a hoax, likely for kicks, as the rest of the world is laughing at the clown car that is the Trump Administration. Think about that, and be absolutely terrified.They also got freshly fired White House Communications Director Anthony  The Mooch  Scaramucci. From CNN: I had promised myself I would leave my hands mud free,  wrote the fake Priebus,  but after reading your tweet today which stated how;  soon we will learn who in the media who has class, and who hasn t , has pushed me to this. That tweet was breathtakingly hypocritical, even for you. At no stage have you acted in a way that s even remotely classy, yet you believe that s the standard by which everyone should behave towards you? General Kelly will do a fine job. I ll even admit he will do a better job than me. But the way in which that transition has come about has been diabolical. And hurtful. I don t expect a reply. None of these people should be anywhere near our government, and yet they are running the whole damn thing. Trump supporters, if you think this is what things are supposed to be like, you really are as stupid as we always thought you were.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images\",\n          \"Gary Cohn, a Goldman Sachs recruit, now serving as Trump s White House economic adviser and has assets worth $252 million to $611 million, says that under the former reality show star s tax plan you can buy a brand new car for $1,000, but that s not all, folks, In addition to that, you can renovate your entire kitchen for $1,000. And you can buy a UNICORN for just five bucks, and all because Trump is the best person ever!Cohn took the podium to tell voters about all of this good news which has to be for real because Trump is going to MAGA so hard, you ll also be able to take your family on a vacation for $1,000. Are you getting goosebumps, too? If we allow a family to keep another $1,000, they can renovate their kitchen, they can buy a new car, they can take a family vacation,  Cohn said.Maybe Cohn meant you can take your family on a vacay in your basement for $1,000. As for the brand new car and the renovated kitchen, I got nothin .Watch:That time when Gary Cohn who is worth hundreds of millions of dollars says a kitchen renovation costs $1K.

People just like Gary Cohn. In fact, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that the top 1 percent of Americans would get half of the tax cuts under Trump s plan. By eliminating the estate tax, the plan would benefit Trump, his family, and other wealthy Americans. So, now we know why Trump was so vague during his short speech in Indiana on Wednesday.We re wondering what Mr. Fancy Pants thinks a new house costs. By the way, the estimated average transaction price of a new car or truck in 2015 was $33,560. We re sure that s higher now. Mr. Cohn was only off by $32,560. He was soooo close. Missed it by that much! The average cost to renovate a kitchen is actually $21,797. According to American Express, the average vacation expense per person in the United States is $1,145, or $4,580 for a family of four.Image via screen capture. \",\n          \"Donald Trump took his angry little fingers to his Twitter account Thursday morning, threatening to abandon recovery efforts in Puerto Rico where the majority of the hurricane-devastated island s residents remain without power, water and food.Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello immediately responded on Thursday to President Trump s warning, saying that the U.S. territory s residents are only asking for the same assistance that other Americans would receive. You know, like in Texas and Florida, two states which helped bring Trump to power. And yet, Trump did not issue threats to those states. The U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico are requesting the support that any of our fellow citizens would receive across our Nation,  Rossello tweeted.The U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico are requesting the support that any of our fellow citizens would receive across our Nation.  Ricardo Rossello (@ricardorossello) October 12, 2017Some Puerto Rican officials, like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz, have pleaded for help, but in return, she received a backlash of hate from the amateur president who called her  nasty. Cruz shamed Trump on Twitter Thursday.  It is not that you do not get it; you are incapable of fulfilling the moral imperative to help the people of PR,  she tweeted.  Shame on you! @POTUS It is not that you do not get it; you are incapable of fulfilling the moral imperative to help the people of PR. Shame on you.!  Carmen Yul n Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) October 12, 2017Flashback: I say to all of you gathered here today to the people of Puerto Rico: We are with you, we stand with you, and we will be with you every single day until Puerto Rico is restored bigger and better than ever before,  Mike Pence said just last week.Trump said basically the same thing in a Sept. 29 speech,  We will not rest, however, until the people of Puerto Rico are safe.  Trump added:  These are great people. We want them to be safe and sound and secure. And we will be there every day until that happens. Two weeks later, Trump threatens to pull recovery efforts from the island while shaming the island for its debt   even though he filed for bankruptcy six times.Photo by Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 157,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"August 19, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

About a half-dozen lawmakers have voiced concerns about provisions including a nearly $1.5 trillion addition to the federal deficit, the treatment of small businesses and the potential impact on health insurances costs for people with medical conditions.  Senate Republicans hope to pass their bill as early as Thursday. With only a 52-48 majority in the 100-seat Senate, and Democrats unlikely to vote for the measure, they can lose support from no more than two members of their own ranks.   With the clock ticking, Trump was set to meet top Senate Republican tax writers at the White House as the administration considered policy tweaks to make the bill more palatable to potential Republican holdouts.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 62,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"November 12, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

That program protects undocumented immigrants from deportation if they were brought into the country as children.That was one of Obama s more controversial executive orders, with Republicans all up and down the line calling it a gross overreach of executive power. But Trump s plan is more insidious than a belief that he s righting the wrongs of the previous administration. He promised to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants from the country, who (in his mind) are here because Obama and the Democrats favor open borders, and by golly, he s going to accomplish that even if it hurts innocent people.Like those protected by DACA.So Obama wrote an absolutely beautiful response to Trump s cold-blooded fuckery on Facebook, naming every single thing wrong with Trump s move, including that it is politically motivated and morally questionable. He also pointed out what should be obvious, but apparently isn t, to anyone who believes the GOP s lies: Kicking [these immigrants] out won t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone s taxes, or raise anybody s wages. For eons, the GOP has been sending the message that undocumented immigrants are just one huge burden on us that we can t sustain. White, working-class Americans took that to mean that undocumented immigrants are one of the main reasons they re losing their jobs and can t make any headway in this economy.It s a matter of basic decency, according to Obama. He knows as well as the rest of us that Trump has no decency to him, because if he did, he wouldn t do this, let alone shirk his own responsibility for it by shifting it over to Congress: Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we d want our own kids to be treated. It s about who we are as a people   and who we want to be. The ending of it is a subtle jab at those who claim strict adherence to the Constitution s letters, but not its spirit, like all those allegedly  Constitutional  Republicans and conservatives who blasted Obama over DACA, and now stand with the Racist-in-Chief on this.

That program protects undocumented immigrants from deportation if they were brought into the country as children.That was one of Obama s more controversial executive orders, with Republicans all up and down the line calling it a gross overreach of executive power. But Trump s plan is more insidious than a belief that he s righting the wrongs of the previous administration. He promised to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants from the country, who (in his mind) are here because Obama and the Democrats favor open borders, and by golly, he s going to accomplish that even if it hurts innocent people.Like those protected by DACA.So Obama wrote an absolutely beautiful response to Trump s cold-blooded fuckery on Facebook, naming every single thing wrong with Trump s move, including that it is politically motivated and morally questionable. He also pointed out what should be obvious, but apparently isn t, to anyone who believes the GOP s lies: Kicking [these immigrants] out won t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone s taxes, or raise anybody s wages. For eons, the GOP has been sending the message that undocumented immigrants are just one huge burden on us that we can t sustain. White, working-class Americans took that to mean that undocumented immigrants are one of the main reasons they re losing their jobs and can t make any headway in this economy.It s a matter of basic decency, according to Obama. He knows as well as the rest of us that Trump has no decency to him, because if he did, he wouldn t do this, let alone shirk his own responsibility for it by shifting it over to Congress: Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we d want our own kids to be treated. It s about who we are as a people   and who we want to be. The ending of it is a subtle jab at those who claim strict adherence to the Constitution s letters, but not its spirit, like all those allegedly  Constitutional  Republicans and conservatives who blasted Obama over DACA, and now stand with the Racist-in-Chief on this.

Anchor Leeann Tweeden related her experience in a first-person account on the website of Los Angeles station KABC amid outrage over numerous reports of sexual misconduct by powerful men from Hollywood to Capitol Hill.  Franken, a Democrat, issued an apology on Thursday. The Senate\\u2019s Democratic and Republican leaders called on the Ethics Committee to review the allegations and Franken said he would cooperate. Tweeden said Franken wrote a skit that included a kiss between the two and said he insisted upon rehearsing it, which she at first resisted. \\u201cHe repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said \\u2018OK\\u2019 so he would stop badgering me,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cWe did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth.\\u201d She said she pushed Franken away but felt disgusted and violated. Tweeden also said Franken groped her while she slept during their flight home on a military plane. \\u201cI felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated,\\u201d Tweeden wrote. \\u201cHow dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it\\u2019s funny?\\u201d She posted a photo taken at the time of Franken mugging for the camera with his hands above her breasts as she sat in the military aircraft wearing a flak jacket with eyes closed.   \\u201cI certainly don\\u2019t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn\\u2019t. I shouldn\\u2019t have done it,\\u201d Franken said in a statement. Reuters was unable to independently verify Tweeden or Franken\\u2019s accounts.     She told reporters in a later press conference that she considered the kiss an assault but accepted his apology. \\u201cThe apology? Sure, I accept it,\\u201d she said. \\u201cPeople make mistakes and of course he knew he made a mistake.\\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter, calling the photo \\u201creally bad.\\u201d \\u201cAnd to think that just last week he (Franken) was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women,\\u201d Trump tweeted. Trump himself came under fire last year over alleged sexual misconduct after a decade-old outtake from his appearance on the television program \\u201cAccess Hollywood\\u201d surfaced during the presidential campaign, in which Trump bragged about kissing and grabbing women without their consent. Trump later apologized for the \\u201cAccess Hollywood\\u201d comments, which he called \\u201clocker room talk.\\u201d He told reporters last month that allegations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled at him before the election by several women were \\u201cmade-up stuff.\\u201d Franken, in a longer statement issued after his first apology, was more contrite. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what was in my head when I took that picture, and it doesn\\u2019t matter. There\\u2019s no excuse. I look at it now and I feel disgusted with myself. It isn\\u2019t funny. It\\u2019s completely inappropriate,\\u201d he said.  The USO, which sponsored the tour on which Franken and Tweeden traveled, said it was never aware of the incident. \\u201cThis incident was never reported to the USO,\\u201d USO spokeswoman Ashley McLellan said in an email. \\u201cWe have no knowledge of it. The report is deeply disturbing and does not reflect the values of the USO.\\u201d  Franken was a well-known American comedian before he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2008 as a Democrat from Minnesota. Sexual misconduct allegations have been lodged against several well-known men in the entertainment industry, and Roy Moore, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Alabama, has been accused of having sexual contact with teenage girls decades ago. Moore, 70, has denied the accusations and said he was the victim of a political witch hunt.  Trump on Thursday said Moore should step aside if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true, a stance that puts him at odds with other Republican leaders in Washington who have said they believe the women making the accusations against the former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice and have demanded that Moore withdraw from the race ahead of the Dec. 12 vote. Lawmakers this week shared stories of women and men being propositioned and groped in the halls of the U.S. Capitol as Congress reviewed sexual harassment policies.   Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer agreed the Ethics Committee should investigate. Franken also called for an ethics investigation. \\u201cIt appears that the Senate is looking into that, which they should, and we feel that is an appropriate action,\\u201d White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Thursday when asked about the allegations against Franken. Franken\\u2019s Democratic Senate colleagues Clare McCaskill and Kirsten Gillibrand both expressed deep concern about the allegations. \\u201cThe behavior described is completely unacceptable. Comedy is no excuse for inappropriate conduct, and I believe there should be an ethics investigation,\\u201d McCaskill wrote on Twitter. Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, asked about Alabama Senate candidate Moore, said reporters should be asking her instead about Franken and called up the photograph on her phone. \\u201cThis is what you should be asking me about,\\u201d Palin said, as she talked to reporters in the U.S. Capitol, complaining about \\u201cdouble standards here.\\u201d She added Franken should leave the Senate if the account is true. Tweeden said she was inspired to tell her story by women members of Congress who spoke up against harassment this week. \\u201cI\\u2019m telling my story because there may be others,\\u201d she said. \",\n          \" (This version of the Nov. 2 story corrects paragraph 8 to say that Trump lost Nevada in 2016, instead of that he won Nevada) By Laila Kearney and Karen Pierog NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Democratic-leaning states are set to bankroll a big chunk of the tax cuts unveiled in a Republican tax plan on Thursday, as the plan slashes deductions used the most by residents of states that voted against Donald Trump in the 2016 elections. The bill, introduced by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means on Thursday, took aim at state and local tax deductions as one part of its plan to pay for reductions in taxes elsewhere. Overall, the plan would reduce federal revenues by roughly $1.5 trillion over 10 years.   The bill eliminates the most widely-used deduction - income tax - and caps property tax deductions, the second most-used, at $10,000. State and local deductions are used largely by high-tax states that tend to vote Democratic in presidential elections and local officials say the tax bill appeared to divide its benefits and burdens along partisan lines.  \\u201cI do think this has been developed in a way that looks at who were the prevailing forces in the presidential election and who were not,\\u201d Kevin Sullivan, Connecticut\\u2019s Commissioner of Revenue Services, told Reuters. Connecticut is one of several high-tax Democratic states where, local officials say, middle-class households will end up paying more taxes under the Republican plan. Among those potentially hardest-hit are California and New York with state income tax rates of 13.3 percent - the nation\\u2019s highest - and 8.82 percent respectively, according to a recent report by the Tax Foundation. That group also includes New Jersey, Minnesota and Oregon - all of which have voted for Trump\\u2019s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. By contrast, out the seven states that levy no income tax, Trump only lost Washington and Nevada, while winning Alaska, Florida, South Dakota, Texas and\\u00a0Wyoming. \\u201cBy eliminating or rolling back state and local tax deductibility, Washington is sending a death blow to New York\\u2019s middle class families and our economy,\\u201d New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat and one of the most outspoken opponents of the bill, wrote in a letter to Trump this week. \\u201cIt\\u2019s clear this is a hostile political act aimed at the economic heart of New York.\\u201d To be sure, some Republican legislators from high-tax states, including Representative Lee Zeldin, of New York, have opposed the bill. The legislation would also end a tax exemption for billions of dollars of so-called private activity bonds issued by state and local governments annually to finance affordable housing, non-profit hospitals and colleges, as well as airports and port facilities - a measure that would affect Democrat and Republican states alike. Conservative groups have defended the tax bill, saying it would simplify the tax code, reduce overall burden on the economy and spread the costs and burdens more fairly. \\u201cThe principles outlined in this federal tax reform effort will provide pro-growth tax rate reductions, while adding fairness and simplicity to the tax code,\\u201d Jonathan Williams, chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council, an  organization of conservative state legislators, said in an email. Nick Samuels, a senior credit officer at Moody\\u2019s Investors Service, said the proposed bill would hit primarily high\\u2013income and high-tax states like California, New York and New Jersey, making it harder for them to raise revenue from income and property taxes. Officials in the affected states say millions of residents, not just high-earners, would suffer because of lost tax breaks and less funding available for public services. In New Jersey, 1.8 million households deduct a total of $17 billion in state income or sales taxes and 1.6 million households deduct\\u00a0a cumulative $14.9 billion in local property taxes from their federal taxes, according to the nonpartisan think-tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. \\u201cThis deal is still terrible for New Jersey\\u2019s working families, with big tax breaks that overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest 1 percent, setting up deep cuts to programs and services that we all rely on,\\u201d said Jon Whiten, the group\\u2019s vice president. Minnesota\\u2019s Democratic Governor Mark Dayton warned on Monday that the legislation would eliminate tax deductions totaling over $12.3 billion annually for 900,000 families in his state. The states with the highest property tax collections per capita include New Jersey, New Hampshire, Connecticut and New York, according to the Tax Foundation. For California, the Internal Revenue Service reported that approximately one in three residents\\u00a0took a state or local  deduction in 2015, totaling roughly $113 billion, according to H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the state\\u2019s finance department. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u201cCongress is trying to rush consideration of a tax proposal that will have profound and widespread impacts on California,\\u201d Palmer said. National Conference of State Legislatures President and Republican South Dakota state senator Deb Peters in a statement called the legislation \\u201can attack on the sovereignty of states.\\u201d \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday took a step toward averting a partial government shutdown at the end of this week, approving rules to debate a bill that would fund federal agencies through Jan. 19.

forcing a kiss on her in  when he was still a comedian and the two were preparing to perform before u s  troops in the middle east  anchor leeann tweeden related her experience in a first person account on the website of los angeles station kabc amid outrage over numerous reports of sexual misconduct by powerful men from hollywood to capitol hill   franken  a democrat  issued an apology on thursday  the senate s democratic and republican leaders called on the ethics committee to review the allegations and franken said he would cooperate  tweeden said franken wrote a skit that included a kiss between the two and said he insisted upon rehearsing it  which she at first resisted   he repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss  i said  ok  so he would stop badgering me   she wrote   we did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me  put his hand on the back of my head  mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth   she said she pushed franken away but felt disgusted and violated  tweeden also said franken groped her while she slept during their flight home on a military plane   i felt violated all over again  embarrassed  belittled  humiliated   tweeden wrote   how dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it s funny   she posted a photo taken at the time of franken mugging for the camera with his hands above her breasts as she sat in the military aircraft wearing a flak jacket with eyes closed     i certainly don t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way  but i send my sincerest apologies to leeann  as to the photo  it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn t  i shouldn t have done it   franken said in a statement  reuters was unable to independently verify tweeden or franken s accounts      she told reporters in a later press conference that she considered the kiss an assault but accepted his apology   the apology  sure  i accept it   she said   people make mistakes and of course he knew he made a mistake   u s  president donald trump weighed in on twitter  calling the photo  really bad    and to think that just last week he  franken  was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women   trump tweeted  trump himself came under fire last year over alleged sexual misconduct after a decade old outtake from his appearance on the television program  access hollywood  surfaced during the presidential campaign  in which trump bragged about kissing and grabbing women without their consent  trump later apologized for the  access hollywood  comments  which he called  locker room talk   he told reporters last month that allegations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled at him before the election by several women were  made up stuff   franken  in a longer statement issued after his first apology  was more contrite   i don t know what was in my head when i took that picture  and it doesn t matter  there s no excuse  i look at it now and i feel disgusted with myself  it isn t funny  it s completely inappropriate   he said   the uso  which sponsored the tour on which franken and tweeden traveled  said it was never aware of the incident   this incident was never reported to the uso   uso spokeswoman ashley mclellan said in an email   we have no knowledge of it  the report is deeply disturbing and does not reflect the values of the uso    franken was a well known american comedian before he was elected to the u s  senate in  as a democrat from minnesota  sexual misconduct allegations have been lodged against several well known men in the entertainment industry  and roy moore  a republican u s  senate candidate in alabama  has been accused of having sexual contact with teenage girls decades ago  moore    has denied the accusations and said he was the victim of a political witch hunt   trump on thursday said moore should step aside if sexual misconduct allegations

chief justice and have demanded that moore withdraw from the race ahead of the dec   vote  lawmakers this week shared stories of women and men being propositioned and groped in the halls of the u s

called for an ethics investigation   it appears that the senate is looking into that  which they should  and we feel that is an appropriate action   white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said on thursday when asked about the allegations against franken  franken s democratic senate colleagues clare mccaskill and kirsten gillibrand both expressed deep concern about the allegations   the behavior described is completely unacceptable  comedy is no excuse for inappropriate conduct  and i believe there should be an ethics investigation   mccaskill wrote on twitter  former republican vice presidential candidate sarah palin  asked about alabama senate candidate moore  said reporters should be asking her instead about franken and called up the photograph on her phone   this is what you should be asking me about   palin said  as she talked to reporters in the u s  capitol  complaining about  double standards here   she added franken should leave the senate if the account is true  tweeden said she was inspired to tell her story by women members of congress who spoke up against harassment this week   i m telling my story because there may be others   she said  \",\n          \"  this version of the nov   story corrects paragraph  to say that trump lost nevada in   instead of that he won nevada  by laila kearney and karen pierog new york chicago  reuters    democratic leaning states are set to bankroll a big chunk of the tax cuts unveiled in a republican tax plan on thursday  as the plan slashes deductions used the most by residents of states that voted against donald trump in the  elections  the bill  introduced by the u s  house of representatives committee on ways and means on thursday  took aim at state and local tax deductions as one part of its plan to pay for reductions in taxes elsewhere  overall  the plan would reduce federal revenues by roughly    trillion over  years    the bill eliminates the most widely used deduction   income tax   and caps property tax deductions  the second most used  at     state and local deductions are used largely by high tax states that tend to vote democratic in presidential elections and local officials say the tax bill appeared to divide its benefits and burdens along partisan lines    i do think this has been developed in a way that looks at who were the prevailing forces in the presidential election and who were not   kevin sullivan  connecticut s commissioner of revenue services  told reuters  connecticut is one of several high tax democratic states where  local officials say  middle class households will end up paying more taxes under the republican plan  among those potentially hardest hit are california and new york with state income tax rates of   percent   the nation s highest   and   percent respectively  according to a recent report by the tax foundation  that group also includes new jersey  minnesota and oregon   all of which have voted for trump s democratic rival hillary clinton in the  election  by contrast  out the seven states that levy no income tax  trump only lost washington and nevada  while winning alaska  florida  south dakota  texas and wyoming   by eliminating or rolling back state and local tax deductibility  washington is sending a death blow to new york s middle class families and our economy   new york governor andrew cuomo  a democrat and one of the most outspoken opponents of the bill  wrote in a letter to trump this week   it s clear this is a hostile political act aimed at the economic heart of new york   to be sure  some republican legislators from high tax states  including representative lee zeldin  of new york  have opposed the bill  the legislation would also end a tax exemption for billions of dollars of so called private activity bonds issued by state and local governments annually to finance affordable housing  non profit hospitals and colleges  as well as airports and port facilities   a measure that would affect democrat and republican states alike  conservative groups have defended the tax bill  saying it would simplify the tax code  reduce overall burden on the economy and spread the costs and burdens more fairly   the principles outlined in this federal tax reform effort will provide pro growth tax rate reductions  while adding fairness and simplicity to the tax code   jonathan williams  chief economist at the american legislative exchange council  an  organization of conservative state legislators  said in an email  nick samuels  a senior credit officer at moody s investors service  said the proposed bill would hit primarily high income and high tax states like california  new york and new jersey  making it harder for them to raise revenue from income and property taxes  officials in the affected states say millions of residents  not just high earners  would suffer because of lost tax breaks and less funding available for public services  in new jersey    million households deduct a total of   billion in state income or sales taxes and   million households deduct a cumulative    billion in local property taxes from their federal taxes  according to the nonpartisan think tank new jersey policy perspective   this deal is still terrible for new jersey s working families  with big tax breaks that overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest  percent  setting up deep cuts to programs and services that we all rely on   said jon whiten  the group s vice president  minnesota s democratic governor mark dayton warned on monday that the legislation would eliminate tax deductions totaling over    billion annually for   families in his state  the states with the highest property tax collections per capita include new jersey  new hampshire  connecticut and new york  according to the tax foundation  for california  the internal revenue service reported that approximately one in three residents took a state or local  deduction in   totaling roughly   billion  according to h d  palmer  a spokesman for the state s finance department       congress is trying to rush consideration of a tax proposal that will have profound and widespread impacts on california   palmer said
